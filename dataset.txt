This directed network contains sent messages between the users of an online community
of students from the University of California, Irvine. A node represents a user.
A directed edge represents a sent message. Multiple edges denote multiple messages.

This is the directed network of emails in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak.
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is the formal governing body for the United States Democratic Party.
A dump of emails of the DNC was leaked in 2016. Nodes in the network correspond to persons in the dataset.
A directed edge in the dataset denotes that a person has sent an email to another person.
Since an email can have any number of recipients, a single email is mapped to multiple edges in this dataset,
resulting in the number of edges in this network being about twice the number of emails in the dump.

Nodes: 2,029
Edges: 39,264
Unique edges: 5,598

time: 1463659109-1463507482 = 151627 secondi (42 ore ca.)
